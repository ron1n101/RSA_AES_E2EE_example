Simple RSA/AES chat with using CryptoPP lib and multithreading.
For start:

1. install c++ (build-essential)
2. download crpytopp lib. (https://github.com/weidai11/cryptopp)
3. make cryptopp lib
4. install python
5. Enter the project and compile his(g++ client.cpp -o client -lcryptopp -lpthread)
6. start server.py (python3.py server.py)
7. start client (./client)

   Project not complete. I have a issue with connecting 2 more clients to server. But this project shows how works E2EE.
   Start on UNIX system or WSL.
